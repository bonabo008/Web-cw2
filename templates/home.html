            <p>The village of Walberswick is one of the prettiest on the coast, with the river running through the marshes, its' windswept sand dunes and characterful beach huts. The village itself offers a post office and well-stocked local shop, two pubs serving good food, and a selection of gift shops and cafes surround the village green. There are many walking and cycling paths through the village and its environs, taking you through the nature reserves to Dunwich, or along the River Blyth, crossing the Bailey Bridge at Blackshore to Southwold harbour.</p>
            <p>A holiday at Old Farm, offers a combination of a truly exceptional house with a delightful seaside holiday on this beautiful stretch of the Suffolk Heritage Coast. Originally the property was the principal farm in the village and, in the late 19th century and the early part of the 20th century, Old Farm and its gardens provided a social hub for the Walberswick art colony. Visiting artists included Philip Wilson Steer, Charles Rennie MacIntosh and Arthur Rackham.</p>
            <p>This fine house offers spacious and attractive accommodation in a cottage style, with comfortably low ceilings, exposed beams, inglenook fireplaces, and sea views from some of the upstairs windows. The sitting room is spacious with comfortable seating to accommodate all. There is an multi-fuel stove for chillier winter evenings and the sitting room also opens out on to the beautiful south-facing garden and veranda area, perfect for summertime entertaining. The kitchen is well equipped with a breakfast table and chairs, while a separate dining room has a large antique table for more formal dining occasions, as well as an open inglenook fireplace with a wood-burner.</p>
            <p>Upstairs are four bedrooms: a double with a day bed overlooking the garden with sea views, a small bunk-bedded room for children only, a twin bedroom with polished wooden floors and the Master Bedroom with ensuite shower room. This room also has a lovely bath in the bedroom and a restored antique brass bed. An additional family bathroom is also on this floor.</p>
            <p>The large and pretty garden is a delightful space with many sheltered spots and different seating areas.</p>
